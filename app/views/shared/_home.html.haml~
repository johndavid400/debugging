          %center Welcome to Prototype Robotics, the new home of Rediculouslygoodlooking.com
        My old website was pretty basic, so I thought I would add some features - I hope you will bear with me as I improve the site. I have set up a place for me to add projects, tutorials, and articles. I will try to get all of the projects from rediculouslygoodlooking.com onto this site.. if you want one up sooner than later, email me. I will be adding a place to add comments soon, as well as a forum for general questions/discussions or specific questions related to projects from <a id="book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Robotics-John-David-Warren/dp/1430231831">my book</a>.

        I have also been having a problem with my suppliers keeping parts long enough for me to write about them, so I will be starting my own Prototype Robotics web store to secure and sell sensors, motor-controllers, robotics kits (Seg-bot and Lawnbot400), and whatever else I can share. This means that I will also have user accounts to be able to purchase items from the store. Once you have a user account, you can add projects of your own to the site - I would love for anyone who has built a project from my book or instructables to please add their project to my site. It would be great for others to see how many people have built a Lawnbot or Segbot, and to share their parts used, build tips, and any modifications made. I will also be hosting links to all code on this site, so stay tuned and if you have a suggestion, feel free to let me know.
